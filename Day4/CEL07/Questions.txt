Question:

Topic : List

Question : 
Given an array:
['C', 'C++', 'C#', 'Java', 'Rust', 'Go']
Use the map function to render them in an unordered list:
•	C
•	C++
•	C#
•	Java
•	Rust
•	Go
Create a Component DisplayList which renders the Unordered List with the  props 
In this exercise, instead of manually and "imperatively" coding the render of each item in a list, use the map function to "declare" how React should render the list.
Finally Inspect the code and check for errors in Console
