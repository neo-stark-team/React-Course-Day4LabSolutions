Question : 
Build your own Button component with caption as "Button" concatenated with the count of button and render it three times. 

If 3 Buttons are created the Button Captions should be 
Button 1
Button 2
Button 3

On user click, it should alert which button was clicked:

Create a Seperate .js file for the Button Component which creates a button control on the page and pops a message 'Hey!!! You Clicked ' with the Button Text
Maintain a counter in the Class Component and specify the caption with the help of it

For Example : if the button with text 'Button 1' is clicked it should pop 'Hey!!! You Clicked Button 1' 

and use it in your App.js file

Using the Button Component create 3 buttons in App.js
